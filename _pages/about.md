# Xinyao Li
I am a second-year Ph.D student in Successive Postgraduate and Doctoral Program at  University of Electronic and Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by [Prof. Jingjing Li](lijin118.github.io). Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UESTC in 2022.

I am currently focusing on Transfer Learning, especially Domain Adaptation, Domain Generalization and relevant transfer settings. I am also interested in applied machine learning in fields including Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, State of Charge (SOC) prediction of batteries, etc.
