I am a second-year Ph.D student in Successive Postgraduate and Doctoral Program at School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic and Science and Technology of China ([UESTC](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/)), supervised by [Prof. Jingjing Li](https://lijin118.github.io). Before that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UESTC in 2022.

I am currently focusing on Transfer Learning, especially Domain Adaptation, Domain Generalization and relevant transfer settings. I am also interested in applied machine learning in fields including Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction, State of Charge (SOC) prediction of batteries, etc.
